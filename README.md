# School-Projects
An assortment of in-class projects that I felt were worthy of showing, either because I put a lot of hard work into them and am extremely satisfied with the result, or I tweaked it beyond the required specification. Most are a combination of both.

I won't be organizing them by class (as some classes will have as few as just one project, and that's clutterring the repo with folders), so just know that my documentation and programming tend to get more concise as my classes get more advanced. My first JavaFX program is going to have much worse comments and efficiency than my implementation of a Binary Search Tree, for example.
