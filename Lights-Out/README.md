Another JavaFX program, using a slightly more popular game called Lights Out! The game allows the user to select a board size, which is initiated with black and yellow squares. Upon clicking a square, the cross (above, right, below, and left) of squares adjacent to the clicked square will switch colors; if it's black, it becomes yellow, and vice-versa. The objective of the game is to get the whole board entirely black. The lights can be further randomized with the button, or you can "chase lights" which will use a solving algorithm to get all the lights to the bottom. Click it again and if the puzzle can solve itself, it will (not always is this the case). Otherwise, solve as usual.
